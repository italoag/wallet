/**
 * Represents an event in the outbox table used for implementing an eventual
 * consistency pattern. This entity serves as a record of events that need to be
 * processed and potentially sent to external systems.
 *<p/>
 * An {@code OutboxEvent} stores the metadata and payload of the event, along with
 * its state indicating whether it has been sent or not. The event is marked as sent
 * when the corresponding processing completes successfully.
 *<p/>
 * Key Features:
 * - Each event is uniquely identified by an {@code id} that is auto-generated.
 * - The {@code eventType} property indicates the type or category of the event.
 * - The {@code payload} property contains the data associated with the event.
 * - The {@code correlationId} property optionally relates this event to other records
 *   or workflows within the system.
 * - The {@code createdAt} property captures the timestamp when the event was created.
 * - The {@code sent} property tracks whether the event has been processed successfully.
 *<p/>
 * This class leverages JPA annotations for persistence and relies on Hibernate's
 * capabilities for equality comparisons and hashing to ensure proper handling of instances.
 *<p/>
 * Design Considerations:
 * - The {@code equals()} and {@code hashCode()} methods are overridden to ensure
 *   consistent entity comparisons, particularly when dealing with proxy instances.
 * - The initial creation timestamp and the initial sent state are defined as defaults.
 *<p/>
 * The {@link OutboxService} and {@link OutboxWorker} collaborate to manage the lifecycle
 * of {@code OutboxEvent} instances. This includes:
 * - Saving new events to the database.
 * - Retrieving unsent events for processing.
 * - Marking events as sent upon successful processing.
