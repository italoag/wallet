/**
 * Service class responsible for managing outbox events to implement an eventual
 * consistency pattern. This service provides operations for saving, updating,
 * and retrieving outbox events from the database.
 *<p/>
 * The primary purpose of this service is to facilitate the persistence and
 * management of events that need to be processed or sent to external systems.
 * It collaborates with {@link OutboxRepository} to interact with the database layer
 * and performs transactional operations where necessary.
 *<p/>
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Persist new outbox events to the database.
 * - Retrieve events that have not been marked as sent.
 * - Mark events as sent after successful processing.
 *<p/>
 * Design Notes:
 * - Transactions are applied to ensure consistency for save and update operations.
 * - The unsent events are fetched based on the "sent" state from the repository.
 *<p/>
 * Dependencies:
 * - The {@link OutboxRepository} interface is used to handle database interactions.
