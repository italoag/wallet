/**
 * The FundsTransferredEventConsumer class is responsible for handling events of type FundsTransferredEvent.

 * to manage the saga state transitions related to this event.
 *<p/>
 * This class listens for FundsTransferredEvent messages, retrieves the event details, and updates the
 * state machine by sending the appropriate saga event for funds being successfully transferred. The class
 * also logs the details of the transaction, such as the amount transferred and the source and destination wallets.
 *<p/>
 * FundsTransferredEventConsumer is configured as a Spring component and provides a bean of type
 * Consumer<Message<FundsTransferredEvent>>, which manages the processing of incoming event messages.
