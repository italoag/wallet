/**
 * Represents a User entity in the database. This class maps to the "users" table
 * and is used to store and retrieve user-related data.
 *<p/>
 * The UserEntity class contains the following fields:
 * - id: The unique identifier for the user, automatically generated as a UUID.
 * - name: The name of the user. This field is mandatory and cannot be null.
 * - email: The email of the user. This field is mandatory and cannot be null.
 *<p/>
 * Annotations such as @Entity and @Table are used for JPA persistence,
 * and @Id and @GeneratedValue indicate that the id field is the primary key
 * and will be automatically generated.
 *<p/>
 * Additionally, the @Setter and @Getter annotations from Lombok
 * are used to automatically generate getter and setter methods for the fields.
